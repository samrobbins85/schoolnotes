\end{center}
\section{Introductory definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Information Assets - Data to be protected
\item Authentication - Verifying the identity of a user
\item Non-repudiation - Ensuring a user cannot deny something later or claim something is false
\item Malware - A contraction of malicious software
\item Ransomware - Malware that demands money to stop from doing something
\item Spyware - Malware that records the activity of the user
\item Botnets - Malware that records the activities of the user
\item Vulnerability - A point at which there is potential for a security breach
\item Threat - Some danger that can exploit a vulnerability
\item Countermeasure - An action taken to protect information from threats and vulnerabilities
\end{itemize}
\section{Passwords}
\subsection{Aims of a password}
\begin{itemize}
\item Memorable enough that the user can remember it without writing it down
\item Long and unique enough that no one else can guess it
\end{itemize}
As these two aims are a contradiction, password must be a compromise between the two
\subsection{Transfer of passwords}
Passwords transmitted and stored in plaintext are insecure
\subsection{Securing of passwords}
Passwords are often encrypted using \textbf{SSL}(secure socket layer)\\
\\
\textbf{Hashing}- Encrypting a password using one way encryption, any subsequent password is encrypted using the same method and compared to the stored hashed password.
\subsubsection{Salting}
\textbf{Salting} - Adding a value to the password before encryption.\\
Salting means that even if two people choose identical passwords, the stored password will be different.\\
Salting is only effective if:
\begin{itemize}
\item Salts are truly random
\item The salt is sufficiently long enough to avoid the attacker just adapting their dictionary to include all salted values
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Password managers}
Requirements for a password manager:
\begin{itemize}
\item The password manager should require a password to start it, preventing unwanted access
\item It should lock itself after a period of inactivity
\item The passwords should be encrypted
\end{itemize}
\section{Types of cyber attacks}
\subsection{Virus}
A virus is a self replicating program often intended to cause harm
\subsection{Worms}
Four stages of a worm attack:
\begin{itemize}
\item First stage - Worm probes other machines, looking for a vulnerability to exploit
\item Second stage - Penetrate the machine, exploiting the vulnerability
\item Third stage - The worm downloads itself onto the machine and stores itself there
\item Fourth stage - Probe other machines (back to stage 1)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Trojans}
\textbf{Trojan} - A seemingly legitimate program that causes damage behind the scenes\\
Trojans are not self replicating
\subsection{Phishing}
\textbf{Phishing} - The process of luring people to disclose confidential information\\
Phishing relies on people trusting official looking messages
\subsection{Spam Messages}
\textbf{SMTP}(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) defines a standard template of commands for different email programs.\\
This was created to a small number of users so did not include the ability to verify emails, meaning that phishing becomes possible.
\subsection{Spoofing}
Spoofing is where people pretend to be a person or device that they are not
\subsection{Botnets}
Botnets are used to coordinate the activity of many computers, these are often used for further cyber attacks.
\section{Antivirus software}
\textbf{Malware signature} - A distinctive pattern of data, either in memory or in a file\\
\\
\textbf{Heuristics} - The use of rules to identify viruses based on previous exposure to viruses. Heuristics may execute programs in a virtual machine, checking the requests and actions the malware makes to see if it poses a threat to the computer.\\
\\
\textbf{Sandbox} - A way for computers to run programs in a controlled environment. This constrains computing resources, allowing the program to not cause a threat to the computer.\\
\\
\textbf{Signed programs} - The sue of cryptography when companies issue copies of a program, so that the user can check it for authenticity.
\section{How the internet works}
The internet comprises of a hierarchy of individual networks that have been connected to each other.\\
\\
Key factors in the design of the internet:
\begin{itemize}
\item Should not have a central controlling computer. Every computer on the network has the same authority
\item The network should be able to deliver information between any two computers on the network, even if come of the machines in the network have failed. There should be a large number of alternative routes through the network
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Datagrams(packets)}
When a large amount of data is sent over the internet it is split into small, uniformly sized blocks called "datagrams", also called "packets"\\
\\
\textbf{Header} - Sender and recipient's address, unique number, data stamp and error correcting information\\
\textbf{Payload} - The actual information being delivered
\subsection{Wireless networks}
