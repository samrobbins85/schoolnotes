\\
The plum pudding model was the initial model of the atom, stating a sphere of positive charge with electrons embedded into it.
\subsection{Rutherford's experiment}
\includegraphics[width=6cm] {scatter.png}\\
Rutherford's experiment involved firing a beam of alpha particles at gold foil and measuring the paths of particles from the foil.
\begin{itemize}
\item Gold was used as it was expected to have a large nucleus
\item The screen fluoresces when collided with
\item This showed the atom was mostly empty space with a positive nucleus
\end{itemize}

\section{Radioactive materials}
\subsection{Sources of background radiation by most common}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Air (e.g. radon gas)
\item Medical
\item Ground and buildings
\item Food and drink
\item Cosmic rays
\item Nuclear weapons
\item Air travel
\item Nuclear power
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Geiger M\"{u}ller tube}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{geiger.png}\\
When a particle of ionising radiation enters the tube, the particle ionises the gas atoms along its track. The negative ions are attracted to the rod and the positive ions to the wall. These ions cause further ionisation, creating enough ions for a current to flow. A pulse of charge passes round the circuit through resistor R, causing the voltage pulse across R which is recorded as a single count by the pulse counter\\
\\
The dead time of the tube, the time taken to regain its non conducting state after an ionising particle enters it, is typically of the order of 0.2ms.\\

No change to the structure of the nucleus.\\
Often follows alpha or beta emission. Daughter nucleus can be in an excited state. It emits gamma radiation as it returns to its ground state.
\subsection{NZ Plot}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{nz_plot.png} 
\subsection{Half life}
The half life of a radioactive substance is the time taken for half the atoms in the sample to decay.
$$\textrm{The rate of decay}\propto\textrm{The number of nuclei left}$$
$$-\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}\propto N$$
The LHS of this equation is called the activity and has units Bq
$$-\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}=\lambda N$$
The solution to this equation
$$N=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$$
This can also be written as:
$$\frac{N}{N_0}=e^{-\lambda t}$$
\subsubsection{Linking the formula to half life}
After a time, t=$T_{\frac{1}{2}}$ the fraction remaining is 0.5.
$$0.5=e^{-\lambda t}$$
$$ln(2)=\lambda t$$
$$t=\frac{\ln(2)}{\lambda}$$
$\lambda t$ is a "Pure Number". As long as the same units are used for both, you can use any unit of time.\\
\\
$\lambda$ is the fraction of nuclei decaying per unit time or the probability of an individual nucleus decaying per second.\\
As N is proportional to Activity, Mass and Count Rate N can be replaced with any of these in the formula.
\section{Nuclear radius}
\subsection{High energy electron diffraction}
When a beam of high energy electrons is directed at a thin solid sample of an element they are diffracted by the nuclei of the atoms.\\
The electrons are diffracted by the nuclei because of their de Broglie wavelength, this is approximately equal to the radius of the nuclei. The detector measures the number of electrons per second at different angles.\\
The scattering of the beam of electrons occurs due to the charge, this causes intensity to decrease as angle increases.\\
The minimum on the graph can then be used to find the radius of the nucleus.
\subsection{Dependence of nuclear radius on nucleon number}
It can be shown that radius depends on mass according to:
$$\mathlarger{R=r_0A^{\frac{1}{3}}}$$
Where $r_0$ is the constant 1.05fm\\
\\
The graph of $\ln(R)$ against $\ln(A)$ gives a line with gradient $\frac{1}{3}$ and y intercept equal to $\ln(r_0)$\\
\\
The graph of R against $A^{\frac{1}{3}}$ gives a straight line through the origin with gradient $r_0$\\
$$V=\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3=\frac{4}{3}\pi(r_0A^{\frac{1}{3}})^3=\frac{4}{3}\pi r_0^3A$$
As $\textrm{Density}=\frac{\textrm{Mass}}{\textrm{Volume}}$
$$\textrm{Density}=\frac{Au}{\frac{4}{3}\pi r_0^3A}=\frac{1u}{4\pi r_0^3}=\frac{1.661\times10^{-27}}{\frac{4}{3}\pi(1.05\times10^{-15})^3}=3.4\times10^{17}kgm^{-3}$$
