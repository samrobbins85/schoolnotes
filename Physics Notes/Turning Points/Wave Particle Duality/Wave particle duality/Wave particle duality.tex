\section{de Broglie's hypothesis}
de Broglie created the equation for the energy of a photon:
$$E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
And also deduced that photon momentum is:
$$p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$$
This caused de Broglie to put forward the idea that all particles had wave like properties.\\
The de Broglie wavelength is calculated using the equation
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}$$
\section{Electron diffraction}
Calculation to find the wavelength of electrons from an electron gun:\\
\\
Set kinetic energy equal to eV
$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2=eV$$
Multiply both sides by m and rearrange
$$m^2v^2=2meV$$
Squarerooting
$$mv=\sqrt{2meV}$$
Combining with de Broglie's equation $\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2meV}}$$
\\
\\
When electrons are diffracted they show a very similar pattern to the pattern when photons are diffracted, evidence for the wavelike nature of electrons.
